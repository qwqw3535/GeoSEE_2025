        "---\nThought: What is one of the most important modules should I call to answer this question?\nAction: To infer a regional GDP of North Korea, we need to understand the economic activities and infrastructure of the region. The get_landuse_sum module can provide information on the number of satellite images of different classes within the total area, which can be an indicator of economic activity. Therefore, I'll call get_landuse_sum(Loc, \"Industrial\") to get an idea of the industrial activities in the region.\n\nThought: Then, what should I additionally call to get the information for answering the question?\nAction: Besides industrial activities, the region's agricultural and commercial activities are also important indicators of its GDP. The get_landuse_sum module can be used again with different classes to get this information. Additionally, the get_night_light module can provide information on the energy consumption of the region, which is also an important indicator of economic activity. Therefore, I'll call get_landuse_sum(Loc, \"Agricultural\"), get_landuse_sum(Loc, \"Commercial\"), and get_night_light(Loc).\n\nThought: To further understand the regional economy, it's essential to consider the infrastructure and accessibility of the region. \nAction: The get_distance_to_nearest_target module can provide information on the distance to the nearest airport or port, which can affect the region's trade and economic activities. Therefore, I'll call get_distance_to_nearest_target(Loc, \"airport\") and get_distance_to_nearest_target(Loc, \"port\").\n\nThought: Now I can get enough information. I will stop.\nThe total list of selected modules: \n1. get_landuse_sum(Loc, \"Industrial\")\n2. get_landuse_sum(Loc, \"Agricultural\")\n3. get_landuse_sum(Loc, \"Commercial\")\n4. get_night_light(Loc)\n5. get_distance_to_nearest_target(Loc, \"airport\")\n6. get_distance_to_nearest_target(Loc, \"port\")\n---",
