        "---\nThought: What is one of the most important modules should I call to answer this question?\nAction: To infer the regional GDP of North Korea, we need information related to economic activity. The get_air_info module provides density of CO, NO2, SO2, and average Land Surface Temperature, which can be indicators of economic activity. Therefore, I'll call get_air_info(Loc=\"North Korea\").\n\nThought: Then, what should I additionally call to get the information for answering the question?\nAction: Another important aspect of inferring GDP is the land use and industrial activities in the region. The get_poi_info module provides the total count of POIs related to each industrial category, which can give insights into the types of economic activities present. Therefore, I'll call get_poi_info(Loc=\"North Korea\").\n\nThought: Additionally, understanding the distribution and intensity of nightlight can also be an indicator of economic activity, as it often correlates with urbanization and industrialization. \nAction: I'll call get_night_light(Loc=\"North Korea\").\n\nThought: Now, to understand the economic activity in terms of specific land use, calling get_landuse_sum with relevant classes such as \"Commercial\", \"Factory\", \"Industrial\" could provide insights into the economic sectors contributing to the GDP.\nAction: I'll call get_landuse_sum(Loc=\"North Korea\", Class=\"Commercial\"), get_landuse_sum(Loc=\"North Korea\", Class=\"Factory\"), and other relevant classes.\n\nThought: Now I can get enough information.

Therefore, I'll call get_air_info(Loc=\"North Korea\").\n\nThought: Then, what should I additionally call to get the information for answering the question?\nAction: Another important aspect to consider is the land use of the region, as different land uses contribute differently to GDP. The get_landuse_sum module can provide information on the number of satellite images of specific classes within the total area, which can indicate the economic activities in the region. Therefore, I'll call get_landuse_sum(Loc=\"North Korea\", Class=\"Industrial\") and other relevant classes like \"Commercial\", \"Factory\", etc.\n\nThought: Additionally, the density of points of interest (POIs) related to industrial categories can also indicate economic activity. \nAction: Therefore, I'll call get_poi_info(Loc=\"North Korea\").\n\nThought: Now I can get enough information.
